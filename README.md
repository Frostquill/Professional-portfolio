# Professional-portfolio

The following project was created in an effort to meet the following criteria:

-GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

-WHEN I load their portfolio

-THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

-WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

-THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

-WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

-THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

-WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

-THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

-WHEN I click on the images of the applications

-THEN I am taken to that deployed application

-WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

-THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Multiple branches were created in an effort to cleanly organize various enhancements that were added to the site. CSS was added with multiple variables to provide a more interactive layout for the user. Links were added to various sections of the site to allow easier direction to areas of importance.
